# FI Collective Design Guidelines - Fun, Vibrant Community Edition

## Design Approach: Energetic & Kick-Butt

**Core Principle**: Fun, vibrant, and unapologetically energetic. This is a community of cool humans who are crushing financial independence while having a blast. The design should feel modern, approachable, and full of life—no stuffiness, no corporate vibes, just genuine fun.

**Tone**: Casual, conversational, enthusiastic. We use exclamation points! We say "damn" and "$hit" when appropriate. We're real people having real fun while being smart about money.

**Visual Style**: Modern, clean, energetic. Think less museum catalog, more community hub. Bright, welcoming, with pops of color and energy.

## Typography Hierarchy

**Primary Font**: 'Poppins' (modern, friendly sans-serif with excellent readability and personality)

- Hero Headlines: text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl, font-bold, tracking-tight (Poppins)
- Section Headers: text-4xl md:text-5xl, font-bold (Poppins)
- Subheadings: text-xl md:text-2xl, font-semibold (Poppins)

## Color Philosophy

**Primary Colors**: 
- Vibrant but not overwhelming - think energetic blues, warm oranges, or fresh greens
- High energy accent colors for CTAs and important elements

- All sage greens, muted tones, vintage browns
- Botanical metaphors and earth tones
- Muted, subdued palettes

**Add**:
- Bright, welcoming colors

**Container Strategy**:
- Content sections: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-12
- Text blocks: max-w-3xl mx-auto
- Vertical rhythm: py-16 md:py-24 for major sections

**Border Styling**: Modern and clean
